dstatus : An over-engineered text status bar manager.

dstatus is a status bar manager for window managers with text based status bars such as dwm. Items in the status bar can be added, removed or manipulated dynamically, triggered by pre-set behavioural rules or asynchroneous commands received through a memory mapped pipe.

STATUS:
This project is only half-way completed, and is rather unstable currently. More information will come later on.
